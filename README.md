# -Cats-Classifier


This repository contains a simple deep learning model for classifying images of cats using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) in Keras/TensorFlow.

Dataset
The dataset contains images of my two cats, Gucio and Pulpet. Each image is labeled based on which cat is shown. The images are split into three sets:

Training Set: Images used to train the model.
Validation Set: Images used to validate the model's performance during training.
Test Set: Images used to evaluate the final model after training.
